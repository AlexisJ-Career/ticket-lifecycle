**1st: Intake**  
Upon logging into the system, the Help Desk Agent/Admin is presented with a dashboard showing available tickets. These tickets may be assigned or unassigned, with each ticketâ€™s priority clearly indicated. A ticket's priority can be set by the Help Desk Agent or the queue manager responsible for managing the tickets. The information displayed includes the following:
- `Ticket Number`
- `Last Updated` timestamp
- `Subject`
- The user who created the ticket `(From)`
- The priority level
- The agent or team to whom the ticket is assigned `(Assigned To)`

<p>
**2nd: Working the Issue**  
When addressing a critical issue, such as `"entire mobile online banking being down"`, which qualifies as a business-impacting event, the priority of the ticket is updated from the default **"Normal"** to **"Emergency"**. The following steps illustrate the process of changing the priority and updating the ticket's notes:

<br />

<p>
The ticket has been reassigned to `Jane Doe` from the support team, who was initially unassigned. Additionally, the ticket has been transferred from the **Support Department** to the **System Administrators Department**.

</p>
<br />

<p>
The updated ticket indicates that it has been assigned to `Jane Doe`, with the priority changed to **Emergency**.

<p>
**3rd: Resolution**  
After coordination with the `System Admin` team, confirmation has been received that the issue has been resolved. The ticket now includes comments detailing the resolution.

<p>
Once the ticket has been successfully resolved, it is moved to the **closed** tickets column to indicate its resolution.
